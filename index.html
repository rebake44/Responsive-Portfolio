            <p>Hi, my name is Rebecca Baker. I am married and have a 16-yr-old son, a 13-yr-old daughter, and two stepsons
            who are 17 and 13. I live in Dallas, Texas. I have a dog named Tito and a cat named Penny. I'm a former
            arbitrage analyst, recruiter, marketing rep, real estate agent, and a soon-to-be Full Stack Web Developer.
            Looking forward to finally doing the job I've always wanted!</p>
